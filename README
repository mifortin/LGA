LGA

A geometric algebra library designed for C++14.

To use, first include the appropriate headers:
#include "LMultivector_Literals.h"
#include "LMultivector_Ostream.h"
#include "LMultivector.h"

There are three types:
- LGA - a wrapper around a float with an annotation for the basis.
- LBasis - basic types, named e1...e9.  Combine them with e1^e2...
- LTuple - many LGA objects stored in an array (summations)

To see what is within a tuple or LGA, use LMultivector_Ostream.h and cout the results.

LMultivector_Literals.h provides convenience methods to work with multivectors.

Creating a multivector:
auto myVector = 2.3_e1_e2 + 4.5_e3 + 6_e1_e2_e3;

The geometric products works on combinations of LGA and LBasis:
auto myProduct = myVector | 1.0_e4

The inner product (*) and outer product (^) work similarly.

All manipulations with the basis (e1...e9) are done at compile time.

Enjoy!
